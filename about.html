			<p>I believe that deep customer empathy combined with a data-driven mindset are the prerequisites of a winning strategy.</p>

			<p>I believe that tightly scoped, thoughtfully executed products that are tested experimentally and then iterated on are the most impactful.</p>

			<p>I believe that always treating others with respect, cultivating ownership, and helping others succeed are the ingredients of a thriving team.</p>

			<p>I believe that a growth mindset, scrappiness, and undeterred grit are the pathway to achieve personal growth.</p>
