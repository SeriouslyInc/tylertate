Our team <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/crema-co-launches-coffee-marketplace-to-connect-shoppers-with-rare-roasts/">launched</a> <a href="https://crema.co/">Crema.co</a> in December 2015 after running a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2074548677/cremaco-the-single-origin-coffee-marketplace">Kickstarter campaign</a> earlier in the year. In addition to serving as the company's CEO, I also designed the product, developed the front-end, and currently own the back-end development as well. My awesome co-founder, Emily McIntyre, manages our roaster partnerships and all things coffee, and we have a copywriter, coffee professional, and all-star advisory board involved as well.

So what is Crema.co? In short, it's a coffee marketplace that enables consumers to subscribe to roasted-to-order coffees from specialty roasters across the US. Every coffee is roasted to order and shipped direct from the roaster, meaning the beans arrive just days after they've been roasted.

Head on over to <a href="https://crema.co">Crema.co</a> to experience it for yourself! Otherwise, just scroll down to see a few screenshots.


## Browse Coffees
Crema.co offers around 70 single-origin coffees from 20 specialty roasters — and counting. We opted to use photographs from the farm on which the coffee is grown to make the experience more personal.

## Meet the Grower
Not only do we tell you about the coffee itself — what it tastes like, how much it costs, etc. — but we also...

<figure class="medium">

...tell you the story behind each coffee, from a biography of the coffee farmer, to a snapshot of the region in which it was grown.

## Manage Your Brew List

Our customers subscribe to recurring coffee deliveries using a queue system called the Brew List.

<figure class="medium">
	<img src="/resources/images/work/crema/how-it-works.jpg" alt="How the Brew List works" />

</figure>

Here's how it works: a customer adds the coffees she'd like to try to her Brew List, sets a delivery frequency (from every week to every month), and then receive the next item on her Brew List each time.

Whether on desktop or mobile, customers can add or remove coffees, pause their subscription, or change their delivery frequency at any time.

## Your Coffee Palate, Visualized

As you order and rate coffees, we calculate your <a href="https://blog.crema.co/the-brew-log-your-coffee-palate-visualized-26c85142932f#.6ftw0oq0u">Brew Log</a>: a visual representation of your coffee preferences. This utilizes the latest sensory science research and machine learning techniques to understand the characteristics present in the coffees you enjoy.

Here's what <a href="http://dailycoffeenews.com/2016/06/30/crema-co-coffee-marketplace-introduces-coffee-personality-analysis-system/">Daily Coffee News</a> had to say after we launched our recommendation engine:

> Crema.co “appears to be pulling ahead of the pack in terms of innovation and unique consumer guidance… with an exceptional balance of preserving each roaster’s brand identity, presenting detailed information on each coffee and a convenient, flexible user experience…”


## Brew Guides

We've also prepared a series of guides that help educate consumers on how to brew the perfect cup of coffee.

## Logo

Our emblem is inspired by the rosetta pattern used in latte art. The term "crema" refers to the copper layer of foam on top of an espresso.
