Flight booking is standard fare. You enter your destination, specificy your travel dates, and look for the lowest price possible. As the rise of budget airlines proves, cost is king for most of us.

But not everyone. For the rare few who need help lightening their wallets, airlines are there to oblige. For a mere $25,000 you can fly first class from San Francisco to Dubai and sleep in your private room, lounge around the bar, have a five-course meal, and even visit the spa or shower, all while cruising along at 30,000 feet. Or so I'm told.

Most travel websites and apps cater to us price-sensitive hoi polloi. But what would an app geared towards luxury travelers look like? It's been a while since I designed an iOS app, so I thought it could be a useful exercise to spend a day or two designing such an app. Here's what I came up with.

> The brief: design a flight-booking app for luxury and business-class travelers.

## Logo screen

Since the brief was to design a luxury travel brand, I named my app “Lux" and selected a regal but modern color palette.

## Flight Search

Like all flight search, the user needs to be able to choose between one-way or return flights, enter the origin and destination airports, and choose dates, number of travelers, and cabin class. I thought it would also be helpful to show locations visited by the user in the past, making it convenient to book a flight to one of their often-visited destinations.

## Flight Search Results

The search results contain key details for outbound and return flights in a neatly organized grid, including icons for flight amenities. By default the results are sorted by their “Lux score”—a (hypothetical) algorithm that prioritizes faster, more luxurious flights over longer flights with fewer amenities. But the user can also quickly choose an alternative sort if they desire, as well as easily limit their search to only nonstop flights. These seem to be the two most important sorting and filtering criteria, so I wanted to included them here rather than displace them to a separate screen.

## Search filters

Should the user wish to further refine their search, they can tap the filter icon at the top right corner of the search results screen to reveal a dedicated panel of controls. Narrow by price, duration, airline, or by flight amenities.

## Flight details

Tap on any flight to see more information. Because the experience is central to our sophisticated customers, we provide photos of the aircraft, cabin, and lounge as you might expect to see when booking a 5-star hotel, and call attention to the amenities available on the flight.
