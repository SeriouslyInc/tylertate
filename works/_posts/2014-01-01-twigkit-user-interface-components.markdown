In 2009 I co-founded Twigkit, a London-based enterprise software company that provides tools for rapidly building data-driven applications. My responsibilities included leading the user experience, visual design, and front-end development of Twigkit’s products, spearheading our marketing efforts, and helping key customers — including The Financial Times, Rolls-Royce, Qualcomm, BASF, Thomson-Reuters, Vodafone, Gemalto, and ITV — achieve superb search user interfaces.

To give you a better idea of what Twigkit does, here's a screenshot of the homepage that I designed prior to my departure in 2014, followed by some of the content and customer examples we used on the website.

## Enterprise Search

Our sustained, single-minded focus has culminated in the **best search user experience in enterprise software**. Beyond being easy to use, Twigkit’s suite of tools enables knowledge workers to do their jobs better by collaboratively saving searches, bookmarking search results, annotating documents, and more. Built for enterprise architecture, Twigkit also abstracts access to disparate data providers, and integrates with Active Directory for document-level security.

## Site Search

With easy to configure user interface components, semantic HTML output, and modular CSS, Twigkit has been built for **seamless integration** with existing websites, from look and feel to user accounts. And, optimized for tables and smartphones, Twigkit helps companies deliver great experiences to their customers on any device.

## Specialized Applications

By providing a layer of data abstraction, Twigkit reaches across organizational silos, making it possible to surface data from numerous search platforms and data warehouses in a single application. When combined with our data visualization library, geospatial mapping components, and collaborative features such as commenting and bookmarking, Twigkit delivers the flexibility to create specialized research and discovery applications more easily than ever before.

## How It Works

I helped Twigkit develop a library of user interface components for everything from the search box and as-you-type-suggestions, to faceted navigation and pagination, to advanced charts and graphs. In my UX Magazine article [From Pattern to Component](http://uxmag.com/articles/from-pattern-to-component), I summarized this component-based approach:

> While design patterns are a structured description of how something should work, a UI component is a reusable building block that fully encapsulates all the code necessary to put that design pattern into action. A component offers a refined, tested solution that fully addresses every nuance and is easy to incorporate into the surrounding interface.

The video below walks through the process of using Twigkit's components to rapidly build an application.

## Thought Leadership

While at Twigkit I frequently wrote and spoke about the user experience of search.
