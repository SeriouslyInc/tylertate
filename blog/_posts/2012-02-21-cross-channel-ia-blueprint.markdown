The practice of information architecture is undergoing a tectonic shift away from creating individual websites and towards designing cross-channel experiences that span both the digital—from desktop to mobile—and the physical—from print to storefront. While the information architect's skillset is well-suited for this new challenge, our existing tools are not.

## Service blueprints aren't exactly what we need

Imported from the field of service design, G. Lynn Shostack's _service blueprint_ is often suggested as a tool for cross-channel planning. Yet it's not a perfect fit:

* **Too process-oriented**. Service blueprints present customer actions sequentially. While desirable for planning specific flows (such as a checkout process), it's obstructive when trying to outline a comprehensive strategy.

* **Minimal attention to channels**. Service blueprints document the "physical evidence" associated with each action, but fail to account for how a single action might be performed on multiple channels.

* **Meant for a different purpose**. With their lines of interaction, visibility, and internal visibility, service blueprints simply weren't intended to be used for planning cross-channel information architecture

## What do we need, then?

Before brainstorming solutions, we should clarify the problem. Andrea Resmini and Lucas Rosati have discussed five principles for designing successful cross-channel experiences; [Peter Morville](http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/morville/crosschannel-strategy) advocates six; to me, these three seem the most fundamental:

* **Consistent.** Each channel should enable users to perform a given task in a like manner. For instance, a bank customer experienced in paying bills on the web should find the corresponding smartphone bill-paying facility familiar, even on first use.

* **Optimized.** Each channel should play to its strengths. Desktop applications are optimized for large screens; mobile apps for small ones. Optimization is in tension with consistency.

* **Continuous.** Each channel must be aware of all the others. Add a bicycle helmet to your shopping cart on the Web, and it should appear in the cart on your phone.

## A starting point

What would a tool that aimed to facilitate consistent, optimized, continuous cross-channel planning look like? In [Pervasive Information Architecture](http://pervasiveia.com/), Resmini and Rosati presented their CHU cube which places *tasks* and *channels* each on their own axes.

Ammendment: *After publishing this post, [Gianluca Brugnoli](https://twitter.com/#!/lowresolution) of Frog Design pointed out its resemblence to the [Touchpoints Matrix](http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/108) he himself developed in 2009. I hadn't come across this tool before, but the similarity is striking.*

## Building on the foundation

Juxtaposing tasks and channels is a useful starting point, though the CHUbe's multidimensional layers make it a bit unwieldy. For our diagram, let's do the following:

1. **Identify user tasks**—these become the X-axis.
2. **List channels**—these become the Y-axis.
3. **Prioritize and describe each per-channel task**—these are the table cells
4. **Identify shared components**—these are listed in a bottom row

I call this a *cross-channel blueprint*. The exercise can be performed by a lone designer or collaboratively with sticky notes or in front of a whiteboard. It brings about:

* A global view of important user tasks
* The possible channels through which users might attempt those tasks
* A set of task priorities for each channel
* A set of channel priorities for each task
* An overview of which components need to be shared across channels

## What do you think?

This is but a first attempt at a developing a tool suitable for the new era of cross-channel information architecture. As such, it needs practice, iteration, and experimentation. If you've been working in this space, please chime in with how the cross-channel blueprint jives with your own experience.
