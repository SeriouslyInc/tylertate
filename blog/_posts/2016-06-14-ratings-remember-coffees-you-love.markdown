title: "Ratings: Remember the Coffees You Love"
snippet: "Have you ever sipped a coffee that blew your mind, but couldn’t remember which one it was a couple weeks later? Some people keep taster’s notebooks for this very purpose, chronicling their experience for every wine or cheese they encounter. For the less studious of us, a simpler, less demanding memory aid would be even better. Enter today’s announcement. We’ve just rolled out a highly requested new feature: personal ratings. For every coffee you order through Crema.co, you can now give a straightforward thumbs up (“Exciting!”) or thumbs down (“Dull.”) — either you loved it or you didn’t."
