title: "What Peet’s acquisition of Stumptown and Intelligentsia says about the state of coffee"
snippet: "Peet’s Coffee & Tea went on a buying spree this past fall, gulping down both Stumptown and Intelligentsia — two pioneers of the booming third-wave coffee movement. So, why talk about it months later? I was recently asked why I thought Crema.co’s unique coffee subscription model was well placed to succeed. In particular, why letting customers choose coffees from independent specialty roasters was better than, say, just sending them a rotating coffee every month. The question got me thinking about the reporting around Peet’s acquisitions, the reaction to it, and it’s significance for specialty coffee."
