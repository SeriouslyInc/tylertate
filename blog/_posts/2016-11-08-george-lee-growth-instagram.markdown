title: "George Lee on Running Growth for a 500M+ User Social Network"
snippet: "George Lee, former head of growth at Instagram, opened with an anecdote of two business owners he talked to while conducting user research at Instagram. The owners operated a company called Heath Ceramics; it had been running for decades as a wholesale company that sold through resellers until Catherine Bailey and Robin Petravic took over. Shortly thereafter, they realized there was a problem: they had no direct relationship with their customers. Their wholesale model had disintermediated them from their audience. So what did they do about it? They pushed pause on growth, and reset the company as a retailer."
