We’ve been putting together a small slide deck explaining what’s wrong with customer relationship management (CRM) as we know it, and how Nutshell is getting it right. Fortunately for us, there’s a whole lot of room for improvement.


## CRM is Broken
Sales software is in a pretty dire state. The current CRM market offers dated, difficult-to-use products that don’t work as well as they should. Specifically:

1. **Poor Usability**. CRMs have added one complicated feature after another, but continually fail at making software usable.
2. **Double Entry**. People must schedule events in Outlook, then re-enter the same activities in the CRM.
3. **Painful Reporting**. It takes a computer scientist to generate a meaningful report with most CRMs.
4. **Unstructured Data**. CRMs don’t provide enough structure to accommodate common data such as products and competitors.
5. **Difficult Setup**. CRMs often take a full-time professional weeks of installation, followed by ongoing maintenance.
6. **Shared Usernames**. CRMs encourage sales teams to share accounts, hurting accountability and personalization.

We think we can do better.


## Technological Progress
The last decade saw the rise of the smartphone, social networking, and rich web applications. That’s where we come in. Unlike other CRMs on the market, we take full advantage of modern tools and technologies to make CRM both more useful and more usable.

## Access Anywhere
On your phone while you take the elevator, on your iPad during your cab ride, or on your laptop at the cafe. Nutshell is hosted in the cloud and provided as software as a service, so it’s accessible everywhere. And with our native iPhone app, Nutshell is as mobile as you are. (You can even use it at the office.)
