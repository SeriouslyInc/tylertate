title: "Personalized Recommendations: Coffees Tailored to You"
snippet: "There’s something to be said for serendipity. A new or surprising experience can be unexpectedly gratifying — whether that’s tasting an extraordinary coffee or happening upon a delightful cafe you never knew was down that side street. But it can also backfire — blind dates can bomb, and Harry Potter fans know unusual jelly beans can be… unsettling. When it comes to coffee, as with many things in life, there is a golden mean between serendipity and predictability. Today, we’re bringing together the best of both, thanks to the variety of coffees offered on Crema.co, and our ability to learn from what you drink."
