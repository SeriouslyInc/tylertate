title: "Dollar Shave Club and the Disruption of Retail"
snippet: "Yesterday it came out that Unilever is acquiring Dollar Shave Club (DSC) for $1 billion in cash for what is probably the biggest exit so far for a direct-to-consumer brand. Garnering a 5x revenue multiple, capturing 5% market share, and achieving unicorn status in a relatively small market all make DSC a notable success story. Hereâ€™s a closer look at what I find interesting about the DSC deal, their approach, and a few other companies with similar dynamics."
