What does building a brand new CRM for medium-sized businesses look like? Way before pushing our first pixel, we listened to people recount their frustrations with CRMs on the market today. We had long discussions about how we wanted to both empower sales people to do their job more efficiently, and enable the business to control and codify the sales process. We spent long sessions in front of the whiteboard, and days sketching out and talking through these ideas. Now in the final stages of development (eying a launch later this year), we thought it as good a time as any to show you a few of those early sketches.
