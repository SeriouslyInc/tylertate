title: "On Consistency, Part 3: Cross-Channel Guidelines"
---

In [Part 1](http://tylertate.com/blog/2012/03/08/on-consistency-three-levels.html) I identified three *levels* of consistency: internal, local, and external (analogous to creature, habitat, and ecosystem). In [Part 2](http://tylertate.com/blog/2012/03/09/on-consistency-four-types.html) I discussed four *types* of consistency: functional, behavioral, organizational, and aesthetic.

In this third and final installment, I'd like to offer some very basic guidelines for appropriately aligning consistency across the multiple channels of an ecosystem.

###Functional
The function of a channel should be optimized for its own comparative advantage; in other words, what it has the potential of doing better than any other channel in the ecosystem. In this way, its function need not be externally *consistent*, as much as it should be *complimentary* to the rest of the ecosystem, yet internally consistent.

###Behavioral
There is a behavioral tension between the local habitat—be it website conventions or operating system patterns—and the process flows of the ecosystem. Great effort should be exerted to reconcile these differences. Where perfect integration isn’t possible, erring on the side of local consistency is often the more conciliatory approach.

###Organizational
Organizational consistency should almost always favor the external ecosystem over the local or internal. Using a consistent organizational scheme across all channels of the ecosystem is one of the most important factors in delivering a seamless cross-channel experience.

###Aesthetic
Aesthetics has major implications across all three levels. It should certainly maintain internal consistency. Yet there is again a tension between the local habitat and external ecosystem that must be carefully negotiated. While the aspects of the look and feel that involve branding, such as color, should be consistent with the ecosystem, the overriding style of the user interface should match its local habitat.
