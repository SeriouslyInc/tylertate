title: "On Consistency, Part 2: Four Types"
snippet: "In [part 1](http://tylertate.com/blog/2012/03/08/on-consistency-three-levels.html) I outlined three common *levels* of consistency: internal, local, and external (analogous to creature, habitat, ecosystem). Here I'd like to turn our attention to a second dimension: *type*. While *level* answers the question, 'Is object A similar to object B?', *type* is concerned with: '*In what way* is object A similar with object B?'"

In [part 1](http://tylertate.com/blog/2012/03/08/on-consistency-three-levels.html) I outlined three common *levels* of consistency: internal, local, and external (analogous to creature, habitat, ecosystem). Here I'd like to turn our attention to a second dimension: *type*.

While *level* answers the question, "Is object A similar to object B?", *type* is concerned with: "*In what way* is object A similar with object B?"

##Four types of consistency
There are many ways to slice cakes and skin cats, yet these four types of consistency seem most relevant to cross-channel design:

* **Function**. *Purpose*. The purpose of a print catalog is to encourage serendipitous discovery. The purpose of a retailer's website is to facilitate both discovery and the lookup of known items.
* **Behavior**. *How it works*. The interaction design. The process flow involved in completing a task.
* **Organization**. *How it's organized*. The taxonomy driving both digital and physical wayfinding. For instance, the way in which products are organized in stores of both the online and brick-and-mortar sort.
* **Aesthetics**. *How it looks*. The visual style.

##Putting the pieces together
Breaking consistency down into its component parts is more than just a thought exercise. A careful consideration of the levels and types of consistency is central to designing seamless cross-channel experiences.

In particular, it's useful to consider which levels and types of consistency should take precedence over others. A retailer creating an iPhone application, for instance, might decide that the *behavior* should be consistent with its *local* habitat (in this case, other iPhone apps), whereas the *organization* scheme should match that of the *external* ecosystem.
