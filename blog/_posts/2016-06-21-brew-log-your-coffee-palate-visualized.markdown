title: "The Brew Log: Your Coffee Palate, Visualized"
snippet: "Have you seen a flavor wheel for wine or beer? Well, coffee has one too. In fact, earlier this year World Coffee Research (WCR) published a groundbreaking sensory lexicon for coffee, identifying 110 distinct flavor attributes. Based on this new lexicon, the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) then developed a new and improved flavor wheel for coffee. Weâ€™re now using similar attributes to both categorize coffees on Crema.co, and to give our customers insight into the characteristics underlying their own personal taste preferences."
