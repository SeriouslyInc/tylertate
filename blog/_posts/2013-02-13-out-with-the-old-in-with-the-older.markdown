title: "Out with the Old, In with the Older"
snippet: "Browsing the web. Surfing the net. Navigating a website. Traversing a hierarchy. Going back. Scrolling up and down. Returning home. Our history of using computers to interact with information is littered with such metaphors. Haphazard though they may be, they highlight a universal truth of human psychology: we perceive the world — both physical and digital —  in spatial terms. However, despite mankind's age-old proclivity towards spatial organisation, the majority of today's web experiences are built to resemble a relatively more recent invention: the book."

Browsing the web. Surfing the net. Navigating a website. Traversing a hierarchy. Going back. Scrolling up and down. Returning home. Our history of using computers to interact with information is littered with such metaphors. Haphazard though they may be, they highlight a universal truth of human psychology: we perceive the world — both physical and digital —  in spatial terms. As George A. Miller remarked:

> "Mankind evolved in a world of space and time. Our memories evolved to record events that transpire in space and time. Modern attempts to externalise and enlarge that memory should not, and probably need not, neglect its spatiotemporal dimensions."

This insight is as important today as when it was written in 1968. However, despite mankind's age-old proclivity towards spatial organization, the majority of today's web experiences are built to resemble a relatively more recent invention: the book.

## The book
Books are characterised by:

1. Pages of information organized into sections
2. A table of contents that lists those sections
3. An index of all the concepts mentioned throughout the book 

## The website
The architecture of most websites still follows this same pattern:

1. Pages of information organised into sections
2. A navigation bar that lists those sections
3. A search box for finding any concept mentioned on the website

## An outdated metaphor
This is understandable. As content shifted from print to digital in the early days of the web, the methods from the old medium were transferred to the new. While this may have been expedient, the practicality of the book metaphor has faded, and is now holding us back. Consider these two questions:

1. Why do most websites force users to choose between navigating and searching, rather than allowing them to do both in unison?
2. Why do most websites not allow users to filter content by criteria such as date, format, price, or rating while browsing?

It's not because users don't want it (more on this in a future post), or that the technology doesn't exist. It's simply because the architects of such websites are still applying book-like-thinking to a very un-book-like medium. They are tiptoeing around a local optimum rather than scouting out the mountain in the distance.

> We need a metaphor for interacting with information that acknowledges the spatial reality of human psychology.

## Looking to the future
The time has come to adopt a more appropriate metaphor for interacting with digital information, one that acknowledges the spatial reality of human psychology. It's time to embrace  **information wayfinding**.

I'm hoping to investigating the concept of information wayfinding over a series of upcoming posts, so stay tuned! In the meantime, I'd love to hear your thoughts about the ideas discussed so far.
