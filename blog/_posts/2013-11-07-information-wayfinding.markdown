We are drowning in information. As more and more data floods in, we find ourselves in a state of information anxiety.

“Big data” is today’s buzzword of choice. People like to talk about using clever technology to “make sense of big data.” I would suggest, however, that big data is not a technology problem. It’s a people problem.
