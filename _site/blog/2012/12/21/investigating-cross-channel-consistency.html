<p>The gestalt principle of consistency has served designers well for generations. But today, the designer’s canvas is expanding to include entire ecosystems where digital channels such as web and mobile must work in harmony with physical channels, from print media to the natural environment. As our remit expands, we must revisit the principles that have made us successful in the past, and reinterpret them for the future.</p>

<p>The <em>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</em> defines consistency as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The agreement or harmony of parts or features to one another or a whole.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As designers, we have an intuitive understanding of how to achieve consistency. As we move from designing simple to increasingly complex systems, however, our intuition must be bolstered with a more systematic approach.</p>

<p>I suggest that consistency can be divided into two dimensions, which I call the realm of consistency and the nature of consistency. First, we’ll investigate each of these dimensions; then we can consider how a systematic approach can be applied to the design of cross-channel experiences.</p>
