	</header>

	<section class="post-content">
		
<p>In the opening pages of <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, Adam Smith demonstrates the power of the division of labor through the example of a pin factory. At that time, the process for manufacturing sewing pins consisted of about 18 operations, such as drawing out the wire, straightening it, cutting it, pointing it, sanding it, and so on. Each tasks was sufficiently involved, Smith maintained, that a single individual could perhaps “make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty.” Yet when each operation was distributed to a tradesmen specialized in that task, the team “could make amongst them upwards of 48,000 pins in a day.”</p>

<h2 id="division_of_labor_and_the_ipod">Division of labor and the iPod</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs made a similar, though less profound realization around the turn of the millennium: he saw the computer acting as the central hub for digital devices. This strategy would allow both the computer and the device to play to their respective strengths, just as the specialized tradesmen at the pin factory were able to do. Biographer Walter Isaacson summarizes Jobs’ thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A lot of the functions that the devices tried to do, such as editing the video or the pictures, they did poorly because they had small screens and could not easily accommodate menus filled with lots of functions. Computers could handle that more easily.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This insight most notably led to Apple’s introduction of the iPod. Rather than designing the portable music player to be self-sufficient, as their competitors had done, the iPod was designed as part of a symbiotic ecosystem. The iPod was freed to do what it did best—play music—while the computer handled the more complex task of managing the music collection, and the iTunes store enabled users to acquire new songs.</p>

<h2 id="the_principle_of_optimization">The principle of optimization</h2>

<p>The division of labor between the iPod, iTunes, and Mac enabled the three to collectively achieve more than they could have on their own. This is the principle of <em>optimization</em> at work. Each channel within the ecosystem should focus on what it does best. Put another way, each component should be optimized for its unique <em>affordances</em>, that is, the inherent characteristics of an object that communicate its purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Each component should be optimized for its unique affordances.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A small handheld device, for instance, lends itself to being used on the go and for short bursts of time; a keyboard-equipped desktop computer, on the other hand, affords more focused attention and a greater amount of data entry.</p>

<p>By optimizing each element of the ecosystem, we can achieve cross-channel experiences that truly empower users in unprecedented ways.</p>
