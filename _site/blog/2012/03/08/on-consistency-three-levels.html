		<h2>On Consistency, Part 1: Three Levels</h2>
	</header>
	
<p>Consistency is lauded as a staple ingredient of every good user experience; a fundamental principle of interaction design; a golden rule of the user interface. Yet it’s a heuristic that’s sometimes misunderstood and often oversimplified. Consistency is more complex than intuition would lead us to believe, rife with tension and competing forces, and often seemingly contradictory.</p>

<h3 id="consistent_with_what">Consistent with what?</h3>

<p>We often judge “that’s consistent” or “that’s inconsistent” without specifying the object of our comparison. Yet something may be both consistent and inconsistent <em>at the same time</em>. The question is: consistent with what?</p>

<p>To date, the components of consistency have most often been described as internal, external, functional, and aesthetic (see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Universal-Principles-Design-Usability-Perception/dp/1592530079">Universal Principles of Design</a>). I’d like to focus on just the first two in this post. Internal and external occupy two polarities of a single continuum that we can call the <em>level</em> of consistency.</p>

<p><img alt='Three levels: internal, local, external' class='normal-width' src='http://tylertate.com/resources/images/2012-03-08/continuum.jpg' width='712' /></p>

<p><em>The levels of consistency continuum.</em></p>

<h3 id="three_levels_of_consistency">Three levels of consistency</h3>

<p>While the traditional continuum is useful, the points along that continuum deserve further exploration. In particular, we need to account for how consistency affects cross-channel experiences. In that light, I suggest that three points—not two—should underpin our thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>. The <em>creature</em> itself. A specific website, application, or experience in isolation from all others.</li>

<li><strong>Local</strong>. The immediate <em>habitat</em> in which a website, application, or experience coexists. It could be the web as a whole or a device’s operating system, for instance.</li>

<li><strong>External</strong>. The <em>ecosystem</em> encompassing the habitats in which the various websites, applications, and experiences reside.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt='Three levels: internal, local, external' class='normal-width' src='http://tylertate.com/resources/images/2012-03-08/ecosystem.jpg' width='712' /></p>

<p><em>The three levels can be thought of in ecological terms: the creature, the habitat, and the ecosystem.</em></p>

<h3 id="lets_be_clear">Let’s be clear</h3>

<p>From this vantage point we can rationalize how some forms of consistency should trump others. For instance, certain OS conventions—such as the visual style for buttons—should usually take precedence over ecosystem-wide consistency; the local application, on the other hand, should most often be subservient to ensuring a seamless experience across the ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<p>I hope to discuss a second dimension of consistency in a future post: <em>type</em>.</p>
