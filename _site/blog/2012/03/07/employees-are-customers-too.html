		<h2>UX, CX, and Service Design: Employees Are Customers Too</h2>
	</header>
	<p>User experience design is growing up. We&#8217;ve finally realized that UX is less about creating end-all-be-all websites, and more about designing cross-channel ecosystems that encompass both the digital and physical.</p>

<h3 id='multidisciplinary_is_good'>Multi-disciplinary is Good</h3>

<p>As part of this journey, we&#8217;ve wisely been reaching out to other disciplines for inspiration. <em>Service design</em> has taught us to consider customer journeys from touchpoint to touchpoint across multiple channels. <em>Customer experience design</em> has encouraged us to put our business hats on and align user experience with business strategy. Both of these disciplines exert a positive influence on user experience design.</p>

<h3 id='but_customers_arent_the_only_users'>But customers aren&#8217;t the only users</h3>

<p>Yet there is one flaw in all of this. As we&#8217;ve been striving towards cross-channel design, mapping customer journeys, and dwelling on customer experience, our thinking has been invariably focused on just that: <em>customers</em>. This is unsurprisingâ€”retailers with both online and brick-and-mortar presences are a natural birthplace for such innovation. Yet we must avoid assuming that strategic, cross-channel experiences belong exclusively to the consumer.</p>

<p>In particular, seamless cross-channel experiences are vital to <em>employees</em> as well. Imagine a doctor moving between his private office, the clinic hallway, and the patient&#8217;s consulting room. Or an engineer moving from the design lab, to the assembly room, to the testing facility. Or a sales person rarely at her desk who stops off at coffee shops between sales calls. Understanding the user&#8217;s journey and designing effective cross-channel experiences is just as important for employees as it is for customers.</p>

<h3 id='my_point'>My point?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s not that we have nothing to learn from service design or customer experience design, quite the contrary. However, let&#8217;s not turn UX design into a discipline focused solely on <em>customers</em>; let&#8217;s keep designing for <em>users</em> of all sorts.</p>
