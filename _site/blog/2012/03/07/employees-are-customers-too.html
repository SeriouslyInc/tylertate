<p>User experience design is growing up. We’ve finally realized that UX is less about creating end-all-be-all websites, and more about designing cross-channel ecosystems that encompass both the digital and physical.</p>

<h2 id="multidisciplinary_is_good">Multi-disciplinary is Good</h2>

<p>As part of this journey, we’ve wisely been reaching out to other disciplines for inspiration. <em>Service design</em> has taught us to consider customer journeys from touchpoint to touchpoint across multiple channels. <em>Customer experience design</em> has encouraged us to put our business hats on and align user experience with business strategy. Both of these disciplines exert a positive influence on user experience design.</p>

<h2 id="customers_arent_the_only_users">Customers aren’t the only users</h2>

<p>Yet there is one flaw in all of this. As we’ve been striving towards cross-channel design, mapping customer journeys, and dwelling on customer experience, our thinking has been invariably focused on just that: <em>customers</em>. This is unsurprising—retailers with both online and brick-and-mortar presences are a natural birthplace for such innovation. Yet we must avoid assuming that strategic, cross-channel experiences belong exclusively to the consumer.</p>

<h2 id="meet_mr_employee">Meet Mr. Employee</h2>

<p>In particular, seamless cross-channel experiences are vital to <em>employees</em> as well. Imagine a doctor moving between his private office, the clinic hallway, and the patient’s consulting room. Or an engineer moving from the design lab, to the assembly room, to the testing facility. Or a sales person rarely at her desk who stops off at coffee shops between sales calls. Understanding the user’s journey and designing effective cross-channel experiences is just as important for employees as it is for customers.</p>

<h2 id="my_point">My point?</h2>

<p>It’s not that we have nothing to learn from service design or customer experience design, quite the contrary. However, let’s not turn UX design into a discipline focused solely on <em>customers</em>; let’s keep designing for <em>users</em> of all sorts.</p>
