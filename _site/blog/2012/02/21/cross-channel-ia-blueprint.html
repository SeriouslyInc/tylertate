		<h2>Cross-Channel Blueprints: A tool for modern IA</h2>
	</header>
	<p>The practice of information architecture is undergoing a tectonic shift away from creating individual websites and towards designing cross-channel experiences that span both the digital—from desktop to mobile—and the physical—from print to storefront. While the information architect&#8217;s skillset is well-suited for this new challenge, our existing tools are not.</p>

<h3 id='service_blueprints_arent_exactly_what_we_need'>Service blueprints aren&#8217;t exactly what we need</h3>

<p>Imported from the field of service design, G. Lynn Shostack&#8217;s <em>service blueprint</em> is often suggested as a tool for cross-channel planning. Yet it&#8217;s not a perfect fit:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Too process-oriented</strong>. Service blueprints present customer actions sequentially. While desirable for planning specific flows (such as a checkout process), it&#8217;s obstructive when trying to outline a comprehensive strategy.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Minimal attention to channels</strong>. Service blueprints document the &#8220;physical evidence&#8221; associated with each action, but fail to account for how a single action might be performed on multiple channels.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Meant for a different purpose</strong>. With their lines of interaction, visibility, and internal visibility, service blueprints simply weren&#8217;t intended to be used for planning cross-channel information architecture</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='what_do_we_need_then'>What do we need, then?</h3>

<p>Before brainstorming solutions, we should clarify the problem. Andrea Resmini and Lucas Rosati have discussed five principles for designing successful cross-channel experiences; <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/morville/crosschannel-strategy'>Peter Morville</a> advocates six; to me, these three seem the most fundamental:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistent.</strong> Each channel should enable users to perform a given task in a like manner. For instance, a bank customer experienced in paying bills on the web should find the corresponding smartphone bill-paying facility familiar, even on first use.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Optimized.</strong> Each channel should play to its strengths. Desktop applications are optimized for large screens; mobile apps for small ones. Optimization is in tension with consistency.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Continuous.</strong> Each channel must be aware of all the others. Add a bicycle helmet to your shopping cart on the Web, and it should appear in the cart on your phone.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='a_starting_point'>A starting point</h3>

<p>What would a tool that aimed to facilitate consistent, optimized, continuous cross-channel planning look like? In <a href='http://pervasiveia.com/'>Pervasive Information Architecture</a>, Resmini and Rosati presented their CHU cube which places <em>tasks</em> and <em>channels</em> each on their own axes.</p>

<p><em><a href='http://pervasiveia.com/'>Resmini and Rosati&#8217;s</a> CHU cube plots channels, heuristics, and tasks using three dimensions.</em></p>

<p>Ammendment: <em>After publishing this post, <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/lowresolution'>Gianluca Brugnoli</a> of Frog Design pointed out its resemblence to the <a href='http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/108'>Touchpoints Matrix</a> he himself developed in 2009. I hadn&#8217;t come across this tool before, but the similarity is striking.</em></p>

<h3 id='building_on_the_foundation'>Building on the foundation</h3>

<p>Juxtaposing tasks and channels is a useful starting point, though the CHUbe&#8217;s multidimensional layers make it a bit unwieldy. For our diagram, let&#8217;s do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identify user tasks</strong>—these become the X-axis.</li>

<li><strong>List channels</strong>—these become the Y-axis.</li>

<li><strong>Prioritize and describe each per-channel task</strong>—these are the table cells</li>

<li><strong>Identify shared components</strong>—these are listed in a bottom row</li>
</ol>
<img class='full-width' src='http://tylertate.com/resources/images/2012-02-21/cross-channel-blueprint.png' alt='A Cross-Channel Blueprint' width='1030' />
<p>I call this a <em>cross-channel blueprint</em>. The exercise can be performed by a lone designer or collaboratively with sticky notes or in front of a whiteboard. It brings about:</p>

<ul>
<li>A global view of important user tasks</li>

<li>The possible channels through which users might attempt those tasks</li>

<li>A set of task priorities for each channel</li>

<li>A set of channel priorities for each task</li>

<li>An overview of which components need to be shared across channels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='what_do_you_think'>What do you think?</h3>

<p>This is but a first attempt at a developing a tool suitable for the new era of cross-channel information architecture. As such, it needs practice, iteration, and experimentation. If you&#8217;ve been working in this space, please chime in with how the cross-channel blueprint jives with your own experience.</p>
