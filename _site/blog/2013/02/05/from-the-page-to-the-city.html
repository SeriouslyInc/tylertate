<p>It’s time to think differently about how people interact with information. The dominant metaphor of the last five hundred years — the <em>page</em> — is coming to a close, and a new metaphor is in order.</p>

<p>Of course, books were the universal repositories of information from the time of Gutenberg until the birth of the world wide web. Since then, web pages have been organized into websites with navigation and keyword search in the same way that printed pages were organized into books with a table of contents and an index. In other words, the page metaphor remains intact.</p>

<p>This year I hope to elaborate on why the page metaphor is holding us back, and explore the metaphor that is poised to replace it: namely, information interaction as <strong>spatial problem solving</strong>, popularly known as <strong>wayfinding</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the_image_of_the_city">The Image of the City</h3>

<p>For now, I simply want to share a few excerpts from a book I’ve been reading: Kevin Lynch’s 1959 classic <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0262620014/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0262620014&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dtse-21">The Image of the City</a>. In it, Lynch investigates how to design cities that are conducive to wayfinding, a term coined in the opening pages of the book. While urban planners are the intended audience of the book, the parallels with information interaction are staggering. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Not only is the city an object which is perceived (and perhaps enjoyed) by millions of people of widely diverse class and character, but it is the product of many builders who are constantly modifying the structure for reasons of their own. While it may be stable in general outlines for some time, it is ever changing in detail. Only partial control can be exercised over its growth and form. There is no final result, only a continuous succession of phases.”— Kevin Lynch</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="environmental_images">Environmental Images</h3>

<p>The book stresses the importance of the “imageability” of a city, a quality that helps people build rich environmental images of their surroundings. The concept is very closely related mental models in user-centered design:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We must consider not just the city as a thing in itself, but the city being perceived by its inhabitants.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the process of way-finding, the strategic link is the environmental image, the generalized mental picture of the exterior physical world that is held by an individual.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“A good environmental image gives its possessor an important sense of emotional security. He can establish an harmonious relationship between himself and the outside world. This is the obverse of the fear that comes with disorientation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the_adaptable_image">The Adaptable Image</h3>

<p>Lynch’s environmental images are also highly individual. As with information environments, at any given instant in the city “there is more than the eye can see, more than the ear can hear.” A key aspect of wayfinding is rapidly building environmental images and applying them for localized problem solving, much as a user might do when searching for information online:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The observer himself should play an active role in perceiving the world and have a creative part in developing his image.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“The observer—with great adaptability and in the light of his own purposes—selects, organises, and endows with meaning what he sees.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a_metaphor_for_the_future">A Metaphor for the Future</h3>

<p>As the dominant metaphor of the web shifts from <em>the page</em> to <em>spatial problem solving</em>, I think there’s much we can learn about information interaction by studying how people find their way through the physical environment.</p>
