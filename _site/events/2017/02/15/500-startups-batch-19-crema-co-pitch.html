<p>If you’re like me, you’re one of the 76 million Americans who not only drink coffee, but drink specialty coffee, every day.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Tyler Tate, Cofounder &amp; CEO of Crema.co.</p>

<p>Over the last several years, coffee has been moving upmarket, led by artisanal roasters committed to quality.</p>

<p>Yet supermarket shelves are still stocked with commodity coffee. In fact, five conglomerates control 80% of the $14bn CPG coffee market in the US.</p>

<p>So clearly there’s a disconnect between what people want, and what they’re being offered. That’s where Crema.co comes in.</p>

<p>We make it easy for coffee drinkers to subscribe to roasted-to-order beans delivered from top specialty roasters, whether that’s Ritual coffee here in San Francisco, Toby’s Estate in New York, or 15 of our other roaster partners across the US.</p>

<p>As you try and rate the coffees you receive through Crema.co, our recommendation engine provides personalized suggestions of coffees you’re sure enjoy.</p>

<p>So, why is this an interesting business? Unlike other direct-to-consumer companies, we’re able to capture 50% of every transaction, and our drop-ship model means we don’t hold inventory.</p>

<p>And while in 500, we’ve been working hard to make paid acquisition work for us, and have seen our customer acquisition costs fall through the floor, while our retention and LTV are trending up.</p>

<p>Last month subscribers spent $13.5k on our platform. And while we’re still early as a company, we’re ready to scale.</p>

<p>We’re growing 24% month-over-month, and are targeting 10x growth over the next 12 months.</p>

<p>My cofounder Emily McIntyre and I are bringing together a decade of experience in both coffee and tech to build the next iconic coffee brand.</p>
