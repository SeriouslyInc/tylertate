<p>This workshop took place at UX Scotland in Edinburgh on June 18, 2014.</p>

<p>Search is not just a box and 10 blue links. Search is a journey: an exploration where what we encounter along the way changes what we seek. But in order to guide people along this journey, we must understand both the art and science of search.</p>

<p>This workshop weaves together the theories of information seeking with the practice of user interface design, providing a comprehensive guide to designing search.</p>

<p>It will enable you to create better search experiences by equipping you with both a well-rounded understanding of the theories of information seeking, and a sweeping survey of search user interface best practices.</p>
