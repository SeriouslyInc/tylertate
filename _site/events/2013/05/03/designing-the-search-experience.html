<p>Search is not just a box and ten blue links. Search is a journey: an exploration where what we encounter along the way changes what we seek. But in order to guide people along this journey, we must understand both the art and science of search.In this talk Tyler Tate, cofounder of TwigKit and coauthor of the new book Designing the Search Experience, weaves together the theories of information seeking with the practice of user interface design, providing a comprehensive guide to designing search.Pulling from a wealth of research conducted over the last 30 years, Tyler begins by establishing a framework of search and discovery. He outlines cognitive attributes of users—including their level of expertise, cognitive style, and learning style; describes models of information seeking and how they’ve been shaped by theories such as information foraging and sensemaking; and reviews the role that task, physical, social, and environmental context plays in the search process.</p>

<p>Tyler then moves from theory to practice, drawing on his experience of designing 50+ search user interfaces to provide practical guidance for common search requirements. He describes best practices and demonstrates reams of examples for everything from entering the query (including the search box, as-you-type suggestions, advanced search, and non-textual input), to the layout of search results (such as lists, grids, maps, augmented reality, and voice), to result manipulation (e.g. pagination and sorting) and, last but not least, the ins-and-outs of faceted navigation. Through it all, Tyler also addresses mobile interface design and how responsive design techniques can be used to achieve cross-platform search.This intensive talk will enable you to create better search experiences by equipping you with a well-rounded understanding of the theories of information seeking, and providing you with a sweeping survey of search user interface best practices.</p>
