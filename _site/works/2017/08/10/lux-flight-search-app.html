			<p>Flight booking is standard fare. You enter your destination, specificy travel dates, and look for the lowest price. As the rise of budget airlines proves, cost is king for most of us.</p>

<p>But not everyone. For the rare few who need help lightening their wallets, airlines are there to oblige. For a mere $25,000 you can fly first-class from San Francisco to Dubai and sleep in your private room, lounge around the bar, feast on a five-course meal, and even visit the spa or shower, all while cruising along at 30,000 feet. Or so I’m told.</p>

</figure>

<p>Most travel websites and apps cater to us price-sensitive masses. <strong>But what would an app geared towards luxury travelers look like?</strong> It’s been a little while since I designed an iOS app, so I thought it’d be a useful exercise to flex some of those design muscles and reimagine what a luxury travel app might look like. Here’s what I came up with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brief: design a flight-booking app for luxury travelers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="identity">Identity</h2>

<p>Since the brief was to design a luxury travel brand, I named my app “Lux” and selected a regal but modern color palette.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="flight-search">Flight Search</h2>

<p>As with all flight search tools, the user needs to be able to choose between one-way or return flights, enter the origin and destination airports, and choose dates, number of travelers, and cabin class. I thought it would also be helpful to show locations visited by the user in the past, making it convenient to book a flight to one of their often-visited destinations.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="flight-search-results">Flight Search Results</h2>

<p>The search results contain key details for outbound and return flights in a neatly organized grid, including icons for flight amenities. By default the results are sorted by their “Lux score”—a (hypothetical) algorithm that prioritizes faster, more luxurious flights over longer flights with fewer amenities. But the user can also quickly choose an alternative sort if they desire, as well as easily limit their search to only nonstop flights. These seem to be the two most important sorting and filtering criteria, so I wanted to included them here rather than displace them to a separate screen.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="search-filters">Search Filters</h2>

<p>Should the user wish to further refine their search, they can tap the filter icon at the top right corner of the search results screen to reveal a dedicated panel of controls. Narrow by price, duration, airline, or by flight amenities.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="flight-details">Flight Details</h2>

<p>Tap on any flight to see more information. Because the experience is central to our sophisticated customers, I provided photos of the aircraft, cabin, and lounge as you might expect to see when booking a 5-star hotel, and called attention to the amenities available on the flight.</p>

<p>Altogether I spent about two days designing the app concept in Sketch. It was fun.</p>
