Search is not just a box and ten blue links. Search is a journey: an exploration where what we encounter along the way changes what we seek. But in order to guide people along this journey, we must understand both the art and science of search. 

This workshop weaves together the theories of information seeking with the practice of user interface design, providing a comprehensive guide to designing search. 

Part 1 
Participants will first learn about the concepts behind search, including: 

* The psychology of users — such as their level of expertise, cognitive style, and learning style 
* Models of information seeking and information needs — including how they've been shaped by theories such as information foraging and sensemaking 
* The role of context — from task, to physical, social context 

After this conceptual investigation, participants will have a guided, hands-on opportunity to identify the spectrum of information needs their search applications should address. 

Part 2 
Moving from theory to practice, we will then apply the concepts from Part 1 to the actual design of effective experiences. We will start by reviewing user interface patterns for: 

* Entering the query — including the search box, as-you-type suggestions, advanced search, and non-textual input 
* Search result layout — from lists and grids, to maps, augmented reality, and voice 
Result manipulation controls — such as pagination and sorting 
* The ins-and-outs of faceted navigation 
* Mobile and responsive design considerations 

After considering these design patterns, participants will then have a chance to sketch their search user interfaces ideas for both desktop and mobile environments. 

In summary, this workshop will enable you to create better search experiences by equipping you with both a well-rounded understanding of the theories of information seeking, and a sweeping survey of search user interface best practices.
