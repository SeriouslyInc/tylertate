I gave this talk at the UX Scotland conference in Edinburgh on June 19, 2014.

Browsing the web. Surfing the net. Navigating a website. Such metaphorical language highlights a universal truth of human psychology: we perceive the world, both physical and digital, in spatial terms.

Most of today's web experiences, however, treat information as a book — the table of contents became the navigation menu, the index became the search index, and pages simply became web pages. This vestige of the past is holding us back. To create information environments that are truly coherent, we must view them not as books full of pages, but as spaces to navigate and explore—much like finding one's way through a city or a museum.

This is what I call information wayfinding. By synthesising ideas both from information interaction — including berrypicking, information foraging, sensemaking — and from wayfinding, the process of spatial problem solving, we can gain new insights into designing effective digital experiences.

In this talk, we’ll consider the elements of the information environment: districts, layers, and nodes. We’ll investigate common wayfinding strategies: locate, explore, and meander. And we’ll outline a set of design principles for optimising wayfinding — such as using structured districts, flexible layers, positional cues, survey knowledge, and clear paths.

Come join us in thinking about the future of interacting with information.
