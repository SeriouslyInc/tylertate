People's interactions with information environments are strikingly similar to how we navigate physical environments. I believe that embracing this spatial approach to information — what I call information wayfinding — can help us build environments conducive to the people who use them. 

This talk was presented at the Enterprise Search Summit in Washington D.C. on November 6, 2013.
